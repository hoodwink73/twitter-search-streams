# Twitter Search Streams using React and Redux

This app is built to better explore React, Redux and the [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit)

This assumes a server which authenticates with Twitter and acts as a proxy to use the search API.

The next step replace this server with a Firebase implementation.


# Twitter Search Streams

You can add any number of twitter search streams. I want to evolve this project as a general library to work with a stream of data that is

-  paginated
-  filterable
-  searchable
